A Django-based web application for managing tasks and assignments, sharing the same PostgreSQL database with a Tkinter desktop application.

## Features

- Task/Assignment management (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Status tracking for assignments
- Responsive web interface using Material Design

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your database credentials:
```
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```
