#  **To Do List Application**

## GROUP MEMBERS:
   - Ariel Trejo Renteria
   - Raul Perez
   - Nikhil Khatwani
   - Luis Lozano



This is a unified task management application with both desktop and web interfaces that share the same SQLite database.

## Project Structure

- **DesktopApp**: A Tkinter-based desktop application
- **WebApp**: A Django-based web application
- **shared_db**: Shared database access library used by both applications

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in each application's requirements.txt

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, set up the shared database library:
```
cd shared_db
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the desktop application:
```
cd DesktopApp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the web application:
```
cd WebApp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Django Sync Command (REQUIRED)

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST run the sync command to configure the database tables correctly:
```
cd WebApp
python manage.py sync_db
```

If you get a table already exists error when running migrations, use this command instead of the standard migrate.

### 3. Running the Applications

**Desktop App:**
```
cd DesktopApp
python main.py
```

**Web App:**
```
cd WebApp
python manage.py runserver
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"no such table: django_session" error**: Make sure you ran the sync_db command above.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Task/assignment creation and management
- Status updates for assignments
- Admin user management
- Shared SQLite database between desktop and web applications

## Architecture

Both applications use the same SQLite database file located in the shared_db directory. The desktop app uses the custom database manager from the shared_db library, while the web app uses Django's ORM to interact with the same tables.

## Tables

- `auth_user`: User information (compatible with Django's User model)
- `tasks_assignment`: Assignment/task information
- `tasks_assignment_assignees`: Many-to-many relationship between assignments and users

# The apps should do the following...

1. Create new entries to the list.
   - Entries must have: Name, due date, description, status, and people involved.
   - All the users should be able to see the complete list of assignments. Additionally, there should be a view of each assignment.
2. There should be two types of users.
   - User that can assign a task. This user can create, delete, and edit assignments.
   - User who are assigned the task. This user can only view the assignments, change the status of assignments. 


  - Roles:
     - **Luis**:
       Software Lead/Manager.
       
       You will have to present and do all the talking to the client (Professor). Making sure you know what everyone is doing and the task that are being completed and that are needing to be done. 
     - **Ariel**:
       Documentation.
       
       You will have to write down reports, take down notes, communicate with the team, take pictures, and set up presentations.
     - **Raul**:
       Developer.
       
       You will be apart of making most of the code, oversee the overall code, make sure everything is running. 
     - **Nik**:
       Developer.
     
       You will be apart of making most of the code, oversee the overall code, make sure everything is running.

   _NOTE_: 

   Everyone will still code and develop the application, the only difference is Raul & Nik will do more of it when Ariel & Luis have to step up in other areas of the project. 


# AGILE Methodology:
### 1. Requirements/Planning
_Desktop Application_

Cost: 
* Free

Timeframe: 
* 2-3 Weeks MAX (ESTIMATE March 28th)

Desired Features: 
* Allow a user to use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). 
* Allow a user to ONLY read and mark task as complete.
* A Correct Database set up to integrate data back and forth fast and easy.
* Easy to CRUD. Simplicity, one click. 

_Web Application_

Cost:
* Free

Timeframe:
* 2-3 Weeks MAX (ESTIMATE End of April)

Desired Features:
* Allow a user to use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). 
* Allow a user to ONLY read and mark task as complete.
* A Correct Database set up to integrate data back and forth fast and easy.
* Webpage loads fast, not heavy on memory.
* Easy to CRUD. Simplicity, one click. 


### 2. Design
_Desktop Application_

UX/UI Design: 
* Simplicity, add buttons that do what they are suppose to do. The less the better. We don't want the user to hit 12 different buttons just to edit a task.

Framework:
* Tkinter

Database:
* SQLite

Container:
* TBD

Languages:
* Python

_Web Application_

UX/UI Design: 
* Simplicity, add buttons that do what they are suppose to do. The less the better. We don't want the user to hit 12 different buttons just to edit a task.


Framework:
* Flask, Django, or any we find in TypeScript or JaveScript

Database:
* SQLite

Container:
* TBD

Languages:
* Python, TypeScript, JavaScript

### 3. Development

Code will be updated & shown here:
[Our Code](https://github.com/theArielTrejo/toDoList)

Step by step plan:
* Create a Database & Allocate the Columns and Rows Correctly pertaining to the information.
* Create the backend. Make sure the functions work before we even start on the UI
* Create a UI. Make it look pretty and simple. We don't want to overwhelm the user. 
* Add Features to make our application stand out. Upload Pictures? Add Audio? Easter eggs?
* Research Frameworks, Containers, or anything else that we can use for both Applications.
* Finish the Desktop Application Before we start on the Website Application. 

### 4. Testing:
* Test Everything!
* Using our step by step plan, test each step before proceeding to the next one.
* Checks & Balances. Each one of us needs to test and run the code and give feedback. 
* Group Meetings Every Week
* Get Feedback from Client. Feedback is important, you never know if we make a mistake. We will give the client mocks and updates. 

### 5. Deployment:
* Once we added and tested everything, we will get one final feedback from each other and the client.
* Research how we can deploy our application and where, preferably free.

### 6. Review:
* Feedback is really important here. 
* Make sure we get feedback from the client and anyone else that uses it.
* Fixing bugs is important. We will focus on fixing bugs before adding anything else the client wants.
